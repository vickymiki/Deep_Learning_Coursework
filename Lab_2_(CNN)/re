## Objectives:


- Use CNN for image recognition
- Use CNN for text classification

## Q1: Create a CNN model to classify images 

Create a CNN model to classify the same dataset and compare model performance. Carefully design your model with the following layers:
    - Convolution layers with appropriate filter design (i.e., filter size and number)
    - Maxpooling layers
    - Linear layers
    - Regularizers such as dropout
    
## Q2 : Further improve model performance

Improve model test accuracy to above 88%`? (Using data augmentation or pretrained image classification models)
<br><br>
Plot the model evaluation loss / accuracy vs. epoches

## Q3 : CNN for Text Classification

In this task, we'll use CNN to detect emotion from text. The dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishantjuyal/emotions-in-text.
