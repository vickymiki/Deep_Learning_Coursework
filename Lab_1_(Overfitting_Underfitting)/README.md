 ## Objectives:


- Start to learn PyTorch programming
- Practice creating sequential models with PyTorch
- Learn techniques to fight with underfitting and overfitting
    - Layer configuration
    - Regularizers
    - Optimizers
 
 -  Dataset: `FashionMNIST`, a dataset of article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. For details, check https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

## Q1: Create a simple model with only 1 hidden linear layer

## Q2: Fight overfitting using Dropout 

## Q3: Optimizer
For Q1 and Q2, we use RMSprop (or any other optimizer you prefer). Now let's train the best model you get in Q1 using the following optimizers 
- SGD
- Adagrad
- RMSProp
- Adam
Plot the evaluation loss and accuracy curves for each optimizer.
